# CAD Projects

A collection of mechanical design projects modeled using **Solid Edge**.

##  1. Cardan Joint

A mechanical joint that transmits rotary motion between two shafts at varying angles â€” commonly used in drive shafts and universal couplings.

##  2. 4-Axis Camera Slider

A motorized mechanism designed to slide a phone or camera left and right, extending up to 4 times its original length.  
Ideal for cinematic shots and smooth horizontal tracking.

##  3. Walnut Cracking Mechanism

A mechanical system designed to crack walnuts efficiently using a custom mechanism.

##  4. Shock Absorber and Spring Testing System

The location where the shock absorbers will be placed with 5 asynchronous motors.
